          <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Koustubh ...! </h1>
          <p>
          I'm a tech lover who started with a simple <code style={code}>Hello World</code> and now builds dynamic, user-friendly web solutions. My journey in coding began with wide-eyed wonder, and guess what? That same excitement still fuels me today.
          <br/><br/>
          With over <strong>3 years</strong> of experience, Iâ€™ve become a <strong>problem solver</strong> who thrives on tackling challenges, whether it's debugging tricky issues or crafting seamless interfaces. 
          My go-to tools include <span style={keyword}>JavaScript</span>, <span style={keyword}>React.js</span>, <span style={keyword}>Node.js</span>, and <span style={keyword}>Python</span>. 
          Iâ€™ve showcased some of my favorite projects here on the website, where Iâ€™ve turned ideas into smart, visually appealing solutions. <strong>Collaboration</strong> is key to my work, and I believe a bit of humor keeps creativity flowing. 
          My curiosity drives me to constantly learn and stay ahead in the fast-paced tech world.
          <br/><br/>
          Letâ€™s connect! I promise thereâ€™s never a dull moment when Iâ€™m around.
